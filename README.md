# matNOAA-NDBC
A repository with MATLAB(r) functions to read and decode historic data from NOAA-NDBC that are available on the web

NOAA's homepage: NOAA / NDBC provides oceanographic data for a variety of locations around the globe.

The data provided are clacified as "Historical" and "Recent" with the former indicating QA/QC-ed time series.
Each station has a unique identification number (station ID) used to identify the location
.
A comprehensive list of the historical data by station ID and year is available at: https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/historical_data.shtml

NDBC historical data contain data for each station (if available) from the beginning of year to the end  

This package provides a number of matlab functions that allows direct downloading of the data to your computer given the station ID and year desired.
