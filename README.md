.
A comprehensive list of the historical data by station ID and year is available at: https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/historical_data.shtml

NDBC historical data contain data for each station (if available) from the beginning of year to the end  

This package provides a number of matlab functions that allows direct downloading of the data to your computer given the station ID and year desired.
